run project on ICE
--------------------


(1) set up environment

run the following commands

module load gcc/4.7
module load papi
module load xerces/3.1
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/lib
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/lrz/sys/libraries/xerces/3.1/include
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/lrz/sys/tools/papi/4.9.0-rapl/include

or use setenv.sh in the root directory of the project (../src !)

(2) copy Makefile in this directory to the root directory of the project (cp Makefile .. )

(3) call make


notes
-----------

if you want to generate some data with PAPI set the flag USE_PAPI
for OPENMP support it may be necessary to set _OPENMP
if you want to compile for the ice without glfw or the viewer, it is recommended to set ICE as a flag

note: all these flags are set by default in the Makefile in this directory
